        <h2 class="skills">Skill's</h2>
        <ul class="skills-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Linux <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have a strong foundation in Linux, a critical skill for DevOps and cloud infrastructure. My experience includes mastering essential Linux commands for file management, user permissions, and process monitoring. I've also developed a solid understanding of Linux networking, from configuring IP addresses and firewalls to managing network interfaces. In addition, I am proficient in accessing and managing virtual machines through SSH, which enables secure communication between machines in a networked environment. I have hands-on experience with server configuration, setting up and managing web servers like Apache2 and Nginx, ensuring reliable and optimized hosting environments. This knowledge has provided me with a versatile skill set that supports my DevOps ambitions, allowing me to work across different server and cloud environments efficiently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>AWS <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have a foundational understanding of AWS (Amazon Web Services), one of the leading cloud platforms used globally for scalable infrastructure solutions. My experience with AWS includes working with core services such as EC2 for launching and managing virtual servers, S3 for secure and scalable storage solutions, and Lambda for deploying serverless applications. I've also explored AWS's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to manage networking, configure private and public subnets, and ensure secure access to cloud resources. My knowledge about RDS (Relational Database Service) allows me to work with databases in a cloud environment, optimizing application data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I’m familiar with IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing user roles and securing AWS resources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Git & GitHub <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have a solid understanding of Git, a vital version control system for managing code changes and facilitating collaboration within development and DevOps teams. My experience includes mastering essential Git commands for tracking changes, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts, which helps maintain an organized and efficient project history. I utilize GitHub to host and share my projects, effectively leveraging its features such as pull requests and issue tracking. These tools enhance collaboration by allowing for peer reviews and constructive feedback, which leads to higher code quality and improved team dynamics. I also emphasize the importance of clear documentation through README files, ensuring that my projects are easily understood and accessible to others. Through my experience with Git and GitHub, I have developed strong collaboration skills and a deep appreciation for version control, making me well-prepared to contribute to modern software development environments where teamwork and code reliability are paramount.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>TypeScript <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have developed a solid understanding of TypeScript, a powerful superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience through static typing and advanced features. My experience with TypeScript allows me to write more robust and maintainable code by leveraging its type system, which helps catch errors early in the development process. I am familiar with key TypeScript concepts, including interfaces, type aliases, enums, and generics, which enable me to define clear data structures and create reusable components. This capability is particularly useful in large-scale applications where code quality and maintainability are paramount. Additionally, I appreciate TypeScript's support for modern JavaScript features, allowing me to use async/await, destructuring, and modules while benefiting from type checking. This ensures that my code is not only functional but also clean and easy to understand. My knowledge of TypeScript empowers me to write clean, efficient, and error-resistant code, significantly enhancing the quality of web applications and streamlining the development process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>HTML <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have a solid foundation in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the backbone of web development. Through my hands-on projects, I've gained proficiency in structuring web pages using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, lists, and forms. This allows me to create clean, well-organized websites that serve as the basis for responsive and interactive web applications. My HTML expertise includes using semantic tags to improve accessibility and search engine optimization, while also maintaining good coding practices. I have experience working with multimedia elements and embedding external content like videos and maps to enhance user experience. Additionally, I understand the importance of properly formatting HTML documents for maintainability and collaboration with other front-end technologies like CSS and JavaScript. Whether creating static pages or interactive layouts, my HTML knowledge is a key part of my toolkit in web development, allowing me to build the structure and content for modern websites and web applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>CSS <span class="arrow">▼</span></h3>
                <p class="details">I have a strong grasp of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which I use to bring visual appeal and functionality to web pages. My knowledge of CSS enables me to design responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and polished user experience. I am experienced in utilizing CSS properties for styling elements, including colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and positioning. Through my work, I've learned to organize styles using methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier), ensuring that my CSS code remains modular and easy to maintain. I also incorporate advanced techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for efficient layout designs, creating complex layouts with minimal code. Additionally, I focus on enhancing user interaction through hover effects, transitions, and animations, bringing websites to life. My understanding of media queries helps me ensure that designs remain responsive, while I leverage CSS variables and custom properties for cleaner, more flexible code. With CSS, I combine creativity and precision to develop visually engaging, user-friendly websites.</p>
